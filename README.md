**Covid-19 Statistics Tracker** is an easy-to-use statistics tracker for people all around the world. This tracker will help users stay informed on the latest data about Covid-19 cases in their country and potential countries they have plans on visiting. This data will aid the user in staying aware and safe. Users can search for specific data by inputting the country name they wish to learn more about! Once the user inputs a country name, the user will be presented with the country's flag, name, continent, total cases, total deaths, active cases, today's cases, and today's deaths. 

All of the currrent data is pulled from the following database: https://corona.lmao.ninja/v3/covid-19/countries/country
